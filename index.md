### Research
- **USC - LLM Unlearning & Evaluation**, May 2025 - present    
  With Prof. Sai Praneeth Karimireddy. Leading research on robust LLM unlearning by designing adversarial evaluation pipelines and analyzing model stability under perturbations and fine-tuning.

- **UC San Diego, PICASSO Lab - ML Systems**, Mar 2025 - present    
  With Prof. Yufei Ding. Co-developed FlashCP, a whole-document context-parallelism framework that resolves workload imbalance and achieves up to 1.63× end-to-end speed-ups over SOTA long-context training baselines.

- **UC San Diego, SimWorld - Embodied AI**, Mar 2025 - present    
  With Prof. Lianhui Qin. Built the experimental pipeline for an LLM-driven delivery-agent benchmark in a UE5 urban simulator, including task variants, scripts, and ablation baselines.

- **UCLA - Trajectory Graph Learning**, May 2024 - present    
  With Prof. Lin Yang. Developed a trajectory-graph framework that formulates policy alignment as an MWIS problem and enables coherent long-horizon policy learning.
