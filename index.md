Welcome! I’m Eric Liu. I work on machine learning (with interests in RL and systems).  
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliu4913/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/eliu4913), or reach me at <eliu4913@usc.edu>.

This site is built with the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme; I’ll use it for short notes and links to ongoing work.
