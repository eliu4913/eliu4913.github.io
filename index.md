### Research
- **USC - LLM Unlearning & Evaluation**, May 2025-present
  
  With Prof. Sai Praneeth Karimireddy. Studying unlearning and adversarial prompting to probe sensitive-info leakage in LLMs.

- **UC San Diego, PICASSO Lab - ML Systems**, Mar 2025-present
  
  With Prof. Yufei Ding. Co-developing **FlashCP** for context parallelism in long-context LLM training; achieved up to **1.45×** end-to-end speed-up (NeurIPS 2025 submission).

- **UC San Diego, SimWorld - Embodied AI**, Mar 2025-present
  
  With Prof. Lianhui Qin. Built task variants, scripts, and baselines for an **LLM-driven delivery-agent benchmark** in a UE5 simulator (NeurIPS 2025 submission).

- **UCLA - Trajectory Graph Learning (RL from Preferences)**, May 2024-present

### Selected Projects
- **ZeRO-Offload Stages & Model Size Impact**, Jan-Apr 2025
  
  Reproduced ZeRO-Offload, benchmarked memory vs. throughput trade-offs, and identified optimal scaling strategies.

- **Impact of Object Detection for Game Agents**, Aug-Dec 2024
  
  Evaluated YOLOv8/DETR pipelines for game decision-making; linked detection accuracy and latency to agent performance.

- **Virtual Machine & Compiler (C++/Bison/x86 asm)**, Oct-Dec 2023
  
  Built a VM (registers, stack, graphics) and compiler with linear-scan register allocation for efficient execution.
